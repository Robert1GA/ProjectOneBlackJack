Double-down is when the player doubles his original bet and receives only one more draw card.
If the player wins, he receives four times the original bet.

The player may choose ot split if the first two cards of teh hand match.
For example, if the player is dealt two 8's.
The player would place another bet matching his original bet and split the two eights,
creating two hands total.
The dealer would deal another card for the first of the two hands.
The player.....
Both hands would be played separately....


To hit is to request another card be dealt.
To stand/stay is to end your turn and no aditional cards dealt.


The dealer's play is fixed. The dealer must draw cards until the dealer's hand total is ?? equal to or greater than 17.
